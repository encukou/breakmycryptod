Use this and your system, and all keys generated on it, will become insecure.

Cryptography needs good randomness.

However, when testing projects that rely on cryptography, more often than not,
you don't need unbreakable keys: handwavy pseudo-random numbers are enough.
And especially with automated tests on virtual machines, true random bits are
scarce. Tests pause until /dev/random is filled up, developers get impatient
and start scratching itches other than the code they're testing...

breakmycryptod is such a scratch.

This daemon simply waits for the kernel's entropy estimate to fall low enough,
raises it, and starts waiting again. As a result, /dev/random never blocks,
but it also doesn't return truly random numbers.


Use make to build. Run breakmycryptod as root to break your crypto.

If you wish to cripple your system permanently, install the systemd service:

    sudo make install
    sudo systemctl enable breakmycryptod.service
    sudo systemctl start breakmycryptod.service
