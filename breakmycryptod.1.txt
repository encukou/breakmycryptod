NAME
----
breakmycryptod - inflates the kernel entropy estimate


SYNOPSIS
--------
*breakmycryptod*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This daemon raises the kernel's entropy estimate whenever it gets too low.
As a result, /dev/random never blocks, but it also doesn't return truly
random numbers.

This compromises system security, as most cryptography software relies on
a good source of randomness. Use it at your own risk.

The intended usage is in virtual machines for testing entropy-hungry software.
Key material generated while breakmycryptod is running must never be used
for any serious purpose.

Since it compromises the system, breakmycryptod must be run as root.


OPTIONS
-------
none

EXIT STATUS
-----------
Barring signals and errors, the daemon never exits once started.


SYSTEMD SERVICE
---------------

The daemon comes with a systemd service file.
The following commands will break your crypto permanently:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo systemctl enable breakmycryptod.service
sudo systemctl start breakmycryptod.service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
