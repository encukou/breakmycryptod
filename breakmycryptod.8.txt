BREAKMYCRYPTOD(8)
=================
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
breakmycryptod - inflates the kernel entropy estimate whenever it drops too low


SYNOPSIS
--------
*breakmycryptod*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Use this and your system, and all keys generated on it, will become insecure.

This daemon waits for the kernel's entropy estimate to fall low enough, raises
it, and starts waiting again. As a result, reading from the random device never
blocks, but it also doesn't return truly random numbers.

Since most cryptography software relies on a good source of randomness,
this compromises system security. Use it at your own risk.
Key material generated while breakmycryptod is running must never be used
for any serious purpose.

The intended usage is in virtual machines for testing entropy-hungry software.

Since it compromises the system, breakmycryptod must be run as root.


OPTIONS
-------
none

EXIT STATUS
-----------
Barring signals and errors, the daemon never exits once started.


SYSTEMD SERVICE
---------------

The daemon comes with a systemd service file.
The following commands will break your crypto permanently:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo systemctl enable breakmycryptod.service
sudo systemctl start breakmycryptod.service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
